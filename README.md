## About

Once logged in you can create a board that others can join or you can join somebody else's board...or you can just start playing by yourself on your own board if it's 2am and you're bored.

The board has a path of numbered cells from 1 to 30. Players take turns to throw the dice and moves on the board based on the throw result. Who gets to the end first win....but watch out for the traps along the way and don't overshoot at the end!
